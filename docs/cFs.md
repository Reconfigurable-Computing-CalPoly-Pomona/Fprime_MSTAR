## cFs

The  core  Flight  System  (cFS)  is  a  generic  platform  andproject-independent   reusable   flight   software   framework. Three  layers  make  the  cFS  architecture:  the  platform  abstraction layer, core flight executive, and applications. This architecture allows applications to run on different hardware processors and operating systems. The platform abstraction layer consists of two parts; the operating system abstraction and the platform support package. Each one of them has an application programmer interface (API). These two components work together to allow core flight executive layer to be portable. The bottom two layers form the cFS framework that provides flight software services to the applications.
