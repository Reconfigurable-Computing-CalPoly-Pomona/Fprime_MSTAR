## cFs

The  core  Flight  System  (cFS)  is  a  generic  platform  andproject-independent   reusable   flight   software   framework.Three  layers  make  the  cFS  architecture:  the  platform  ab-straction layer, core flight executive, and applications. Thisarchitecture allows applications to run on different hardwareprocessors and operating systems.The platform abstraction layer consists of two parts; theoperating system abstraction and the platform support pack-age. Each one of them has an application programmer inter-face (API). These two components work together to allowcore flight executive layer to be portable. The bottom twolayers form the cFS framework that provides flight softwareservices to the applications.
