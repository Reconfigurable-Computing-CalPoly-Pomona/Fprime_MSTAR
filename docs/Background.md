## Background
The purpose of this project is to analyse technical differencesbetween Fprime and cFS flight software frameworks. Bench-marks are then performed on the FPrime framework whilebeing implemented on an embedded device. In our case weuse the PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2 boards to run the bench-mark tests due to their availability and their ability to run adistribution of Linux which allows for easy implementationof FPrime.
