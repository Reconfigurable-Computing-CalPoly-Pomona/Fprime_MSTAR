## Background
The purpose of this project is to analyse technical differences between the FPrime and cFS flight software frameworks. Benchmarks are then performed on the FPrime framework while being implemented on an embedded device. In our case we use the PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2 boards to run the benchmark tests due to their availability and their ability to run a distribution of Linux which allows for easy implementation of FPrime.
