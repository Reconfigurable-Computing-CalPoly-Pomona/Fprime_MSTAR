## GAGE 

GAGE is a family of sponge-based hash functions with states between  232  and  576  bits  and  rates  for  injecting  message blocks of 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits. The sponge permutation has an SPN structure with one very light 4-to-2 bits sbox and a cheap hardware wiring i.e., bit-shuffling layer.\{1\} Native  FPrime  does  not  have  a  security  layer  or verification process to secure peer to peer connections between components. Theoretically it could be possible for data to be intercepted from a middle man. GAGE is a Lightweight cryptographic hash function designed for embedded devices which can be used to encrypt data in transit between components.
