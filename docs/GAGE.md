## GAGE 

GAGE is a family of sponge-based hash functions with statesbetween  232  and  576  bits  and  rates  for  injecting  messageblocks of 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits. The sponge permutation hasan SPN structure with one very light 4-to-2 bits sbox and acheap hardware wiring i.e., bit-shuffling layer.\{1\} Native  FPrime  does  not  have  a  security  layer  or  verification process to secure peer to peer connections betweencomponents. Theoretically it could be possible for data tobe intercepted from a middle man. GAGE is a Lightweight cryptographic hash function designed for embedded deviceswhich can be used to encrypt data in transit between compo-nents.
