## Conclusion
Detailed performance analysis was performed to compare both framework's performance on the PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2 boards. We observed that in all FPrime cases, except for the modular exponentiation test where the performance was equal, the PYNQ Z1 showed a noticeable performance difference between identical test code. Given that the boards should be nearly identical, there may be some manufacturing differences that may contribute to the difference in performance. Continued work on this project would likely involve utilizing the PYNQ hardware layer to accelerate performance.
