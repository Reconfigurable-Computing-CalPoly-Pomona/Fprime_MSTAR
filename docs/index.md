The Project NASA M-STAR 2021 works to benchmark the PYNQ boards for flight software purposes.

PYNQ or Python Productivity for Zynq, is a project created by Xilinx and is a member of the Zynq class of devices. F' (FPrime) is a software framework designed and created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. FPrime's design focuses on rapid deployment and development for space applications. FPrime is component-driven which allows universal components to be re-used on multiple projects thus reducing development time and costs. We developed components for FPrime and executed them on the PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2 boards. The components were designed to test memory and computationally intensive tasks. We designed and developed an array copying component to test memory intensive tasks and a modular exponentiation task to test computationally intensive tasks. The GAGE hash function was implemented in FPrime in order to generate data for computationally intensive tasks as well as give the option of using intra-component security features to prevent the possibility of Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Measurements were recorded for each aspect of the project. Future work would involve further benchmarking and investigating the possibility of FPrime implementation on embedded devices in CubeSats.
